# ai-device-setup

Practical scripts and notes to get local AI/dev machines production-ready fast â€” Mac (Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows (WSL2). Covers GPU/accelerator setup, Python/conda environments, Docker, CLI tools, and common AI runtimes (e.g., local LLM serving) with repeatable install steps. Includes checks, small benchmarks/sanity tests, and tips to avoid version pin hell. Perfect for spinning up a fresh laptop or lab box so you can get back to building instead of chasing drivers and dependencies.
